# 🚀 E-commerce Microservices – Hackathon Submission

## Overview

This project transforms a simple e-commerce backend into a robust, fully containerized microservices architecture using Docker and modern DevOps practices.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-stage Docker builds for backend and gateway (dev & prod)
- Separate Docker Compose files for development and production
- Secure, optimized, and persistent MongoDB setup
- Automated health checks, resource limits, and log management
- Comprehensive Makefile CLI for all operations

---

## Architecture

```
Client/User
    │
    ▼
Gateway (port 5921, exposed)
    │
    ▼
Backend (port 3847, internal) ──► MongoDB (port 27017, internal)
```
- Only the Gateway is exposed externally.
- Backend and MongoDB are isolated within a private Docker network.

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Docker Compose, GNU Make

   ```bash
   make setup  # Creates .env from .env.example
   ```
2. **Edit `.env`** with your MongoDB credentials.
3. **Start services:**
   ```bash
   make dev-up
   ```
4. **Check health:**
   ```bash
   make health
   ```

## 🛠️ Makefile Highlights

```
| Command           | Description                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `make dev-up`     | Start dev environment              |
| `make prod-up`    | Start production environment       |
| `make health`     | Check service health               |
| `make test-api`   | Run API tests                      |
| `make logs`       | View logs                          |
| `make clean-all`  | Remove all containers, volumes, etc|
```
Run `make help` for the full list.

## 🐳 Docker & DevOps Best Practices

- **Multi-stage builds:** Small, secure images for production.
- **Non-root users:** Enhanced container security.
- **Read-only filesystems:** In production for extra safety.
- **Named volumes:** Persistent MongoDB data.
- **Network isolation:** Only gateway is externally accessible.
- **Health checks:** For all services.
- **Resource limits:** CPU/memory constraints in production.
- **Hot-reload:** Fast development workflow.
- **Automated Makefile:** 40+ commands for all operations.

---

## 🧪 Testing

**Health checks:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5921/health
curl http://localhost:5921/api/health
```

**Product API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5921/api/products -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Test Product","price":99.99}'
curl http://localhost:5921/api/products
```

**Security test (should fail):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3847/api/products
```

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

- Clean, production-ready Docker setup
- Secure by default
- Fully automated with Makefile
- Easy to develop, test, and deploy
